# MEV Capture

MEV Capture is a high-performance Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) infrastructure designed for the parallel execution era, natively built for Monad. It provides a comprehensive solution for block building, transaction ordering, and liquid staking.

## Features

- **Real-time Blockchain Monitoring**: Continuously tracks blockchain state and mempool for profitable MEV opportunities
- **Transaction Bundle Ordering**: Optimizes transaction ordering for maximum value extraction
- **Performant Block Building**: Constructs optimized blocks with efficient transaction inclusion
- **Liquid Staking Protocol**: Enables users to stake assets while maintaining liquidity
- **Secure Validator Management**: Tools for validator coordination and reward distribution
- **API Infrastructure**: RESTful and WebSocket APIs for integration with external systems
- **Advanced Metrics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive telemetry and performance tracking

## Architecture

MEV Capture is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy scaling:

```

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+
- Ethereum node with WebSocket API access

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/mev-capture.git
   cd mev-capture
   ```

2. Create and configure environment variables
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Set up the database
   ```
   psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE mev_capture;"
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

4. Build and run the project
   ```
   cargo build --release
   ./target/release/mev-capture
   ```

## Configuration

MEV Capture uses a combination of environment variables and YAML configuration files. See the `config/` directory for examples.

## Performance

The system is optimized for high-throughput and low-latency operations:

- Transaction processing: <100μs latency
- Block building: <10ms for a full block
- API response time: <5ms for p99
